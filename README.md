## Usage

Just enable the plugin, it should do the work:
    - Find all enqueued .less files and compile them when needed
    - From Admin you can force compilation of active theme .less (beta)

To enqueue a .less file, do as usual for any styles

```
    wp_enqueue_style('my-less', get_stylesheet_directory().'/styles.less', array(), 'v1.0');
```
